# Hi there! 👋 I'm Michael Peter

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Data Analyst with 5 years of experience in Data Science.

I specialize in creating end-to-end analytics solutions from exploratory data analysis to advanced machine learning algorithms that drive strategic decisions and deliver measurable business value.

Currently, I'm an Assistant Lecturer of Applied Mathematics at The Open University of Tanzania while actively pursuing data science opportunities. 

I'm driven by extracting actionable insights from complex data and building predictive models that solve real-world problems.
When I'm not analyzing data, you'll find me playing football, following athletics, or exploring trails for fitness and mental clarity.

I'm currently looking for: Data Scientist positions where I can apply advanced analytics to solve complex business problems and drive data-driven decision making.
