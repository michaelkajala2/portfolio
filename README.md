# Hi there! 👋 I'm Michael Peter

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate **Data Analyist** with **5 years** of experience in **Data Science**. I specialize in creating **end-to-end analytics solutions from exploratory data analysis to advanced machine learning algorithms** that **drive strategic decisions and deliver measurable business value**.

Currently, I'm **working as an Assistant Lecturer of Applied Mathematics at The Open University of Tanzania and actively pursuing opportunities in data science and machine learning**. I'm driven by **the challenge of extracting actionable insights from complex data and creating predictive models that drive decision-making** and love collaborating with teams to build **end-to-end analytics solutions that deliver measurable business value**.

When I'm not analyzing data, you'll find me **playing football to stay active, watching athletics events for inspiration, or exploring local trails for both fitness and mental clarity**.

🎯 I'm currently looking for: **Data Scientist positions where I can apply advanced analytics to solve complex business problems and drive data-driven decision making**.
